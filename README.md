# Move lines of text up and down

This package provides the ability to easily move lines of text up and down
using the exposed functions `lift-lines-up` and `lift-lines-down`. Both
functions move the current line, the one where point is, by one line. If a
region is marked, the lines encompassing that region will be moved, again, by
one line.
