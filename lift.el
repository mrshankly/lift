;;; Commentary:

;; A simple package that exposes two functions, `lift-lines-up' and
;; `lift-lines-down', which will move the current line or region up and down,
;; respectively.

;;; Code:

(defun lift-point-in-first-line-p ()
  "Returns `t' if point is in the first line of the buffer."
  (= (line-number-at-pos) (line-number-at-pos (point-min))))

(defun lift-point-in-last-line-p ()
  "Returns `t' if point is in the last line of the buffer."
  (= (line-number-at-pos) (line-number-at-pos (1- (point-max)))))

(defun lift-count-region-lines ()
  "Returns the number of lines of the current region."
  (1+ (abs (- (line-number-at-pos)
              (line-number-at-pos (mark))))))

(defun lift-move-line (num-lines)
  "Moves the line where point is up or down by `num-lines' lines."
  (cond
   ((< num-lines 0) (progn
                      ;; Move up just one line to handle the edge case when
                      ;; there isn't a line after the current one.
